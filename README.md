Something Here 2020
-------------------

This repository uses a stripped down version of the Game Engine I am working on to display the header. It has streamlined SCSS, JS and HTML and is built using parcel.

It has support for Gamepads! Just connect on to your computer and press any button to start. It uses a plethora of technologies, from SVG to WebGL. For more information, visit the functioning version at http://www.somethinghere.net
