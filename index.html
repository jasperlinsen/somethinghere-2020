        <h2>Who dis?</h2>

        <p>Jasper. Jesp. <i>Jaspucci</i>. That last one might be made up on the spot, actually. But names are just names, and talents are, well, also <i>just</i> talents. But I have some! Starting out in Graphic Design I quickly pivoted to the future: user interaction and experience. Working as a front-end developer at a small London agency I proved my way up to Senior Web Developer at CNN Internationals renowned in-house brand studio Create, before starting as a freelancer and working on projects such as the Flemish VOD service VRT NU, providing a fully-accessible experience, where the only downside was that light green and black isn't considered contrast-y enough by Lighthouse's standards.</p>

        <p>I'm a passionate developer - if you get me on your team, I will strive to accomplish the best. I won't settle for a framework simply <i>because</i>, if we can make things more responsive, faster, simpler and more fun, I will push the team and myself to accomplish those lofty goals. I will set out a plan for how to reach those goals, and I intend to do it faster than that. I am outspoken, but trust me, you want me on your team if you want to be woken up from a peaceful slumber that slowly eroded your application.</p>

                <h4>The more you know</h4>
                <h3>GamePad Support</h3>
                <p>This site is built with support for the GamePad API! Everything is usable with just the gamepad, borrowing some ideas from how touch support was built for the iPad, with an adaptable cursor.</p>
                
                <p class="show-no-gamepad">If you have a gamepad connected your your computer, just press any button to get started!</p>
                <p class="show-gamepad">You can use the <strong>Left Stick</strong> to move the cursor, and the <strong>Right Stick</strong> to scroll on the page. Use the <strong>Action Button</strong> to click!</p>

            </div>
        </aside>

        <p>Apart from coding in Typescript, CSS and HTML I also have experience with some PHP, MySQL, NodeJS and I have dabbled in the occasional Swift and C Sharp. I have played around with Unity and Blender, and know my way around the Creative Suite. If you like React, well, React is just a sprinkle on top of Javascript. You need me to do Angular? I have worked with that! Also, a sprinkle on top of Javascript. I can work with any framework but my favorite is <i>no framework</i>, as I have not yet found one that feels like it hasn't loaded too many features and options on your cart. I have never seen such complexity as a simple file drag-and-drop component containing seventeen other components, and I will ask you <strong>"Why?"</strong> and you will look at me with that face. You know, <i>that</i> face. And then we will reduce complexity together.</p>

        <h2>Some Dis I Did</h2>

        <p>I could definitely put out a more exhaustive list of things here, but over time some links have started disappearing, and browser updates created glitches in code that doesn't get updated. I know how to fix them, but there is no incentive to do so at this point, so I will just show some details and you can click the links if you like. I have more to show that I currently can't list, so be sure to <a href="#contact">get in touch</a> to see some more of the fantastic work I am doing for a variety of clients!</p>

                        <p>Jasper is a well-balanced mix of bleeding edge curiosity and enterprise level stability. His experience with fast paced creative coding projects for world renowned media company CNN brought us a breath of fresh innovation air to our teams where we already had the mindset of being more innovative than the usual enterprise level companies. He helped pushed our teams forward with his drive for new technology and standards in a qualitative manner and always trying to find ways to write better code. It is this kind of drive to innovate and constantly improve code quality that makes him a valuable asset to any forward thinking company.</p>

        <p>There's more, but you will have to have a chat with me so I can show the work I have done on a plethora of projects. <a href="#contact">Get in touch</a>! Let's also be honest, the woodgrain in the background really got you interested. <i>No?</i> I was sure it would.</p>

        <h2>Why dis?</h2>
        <p>Because I want to show something else that isn't the full-width, stock-photo based header. I wanted something different from the photo of an Apple MacBook with gibberish code scrolling down the screen. And I wanted to show a plethora of things I enjoy doing - from building a different kind of UI/UX to animating bones and using them in browser. Actually, I have an entire game I am working on that runs completely in the browser. I'm still working on it, but if you're curious, definitely <a href="#contact">get in touch</a>, and I might throw a demo your way. </p>

        <h2>Where dis?</h2>
        <p>So, well, there's a couple of places you could get in touch or learn more about me, but most of all: I would love to talk to you and help you build better things! You can give it a go on Twitter, check out my GitHub, or contact me through email or phone.</p>
        <p>My company is located is Belgium, but I am always on the lookout for any opportunity, company or not. If you want to give me a VISA, I am willing get myself over there. Just get in touch first, I'd like to know up front.</p>

        <p>You skipped to the end, so maybe you just want to get a more concise view. And yet, I still added a paragraph about skipping to the end. It knows no bounds! At least the buttons below are esier to find, and this paragraph easy to skip.</p>
